## Getting started

Clone the repo and install Hugo with Homebrew

```sh
brew install hugo
```

Add new content

```sh
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

View changes in local server

```sh
hugo server -D
```

Edit the content, then commit and push your changes to deploy to Netlify.

Read the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) documentation for more information.
